## Get to Know the Authors
**Brais Brenlla** is an architect, 3D artist, and Unreal Engine developer - but above all else, he is a passionate follower of all things 3D. His interest in that field likely started when he first laid his eyes on a video game advert, with this &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo; moment leading him to explore architectural design and visualization, to 3D modeling, game development, and more.
He is currently focused on developing digital city twins in Unreal Engine, where he gets to sharpen his UI design, visual effects, and tool development skills every day. He also loves sharing all this knowledge with others, something that has turned him into a little bit of an author in recent days!
